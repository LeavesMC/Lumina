> Fork of [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia) aims at repairing broken vanilla properties.

**The project is currently unstable**

We are collecting vanilla properties broken by Folia, if you find something, please raise it in an issue, thanks.

**You can check our [RoadMap](docs/RoadMap.md) to see what we are working on**

**In order to make the default more consistent with Vanilla behavior, we have changed the default values of some Paper and Spigot configuration items, see [Modify List](docs/DefaultModifiedConfigList.md) for details**

**[WIP]Although Lumina has ported most of the Carpet features, there are still some features that are not supported, see [Removed Carpet Features](docs/RemovedCarpetFeatures.md) for details**
